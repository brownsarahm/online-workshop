name: welcoming
notes: "-  It is important to welcome people to the call as they arrive. It gets a bit repetitive, but particularly if you're bringing a new community together, think of this like standing at the front door as dinner party guests arrive. You should be welcoming and kind as you invite people into the meeting, also accepting and expecting late arrivals. Expect for productive time to start at something like 3-5 minutes past the start time and set this expectation as people trickle in. This also sets the tone for kind and jovial interactions with participants. As you welcome people, you can guide them toward a shared document (as detailed in the next section)."
