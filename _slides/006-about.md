name: about
notes: "-  possibly clearing misconception

-  not like a sales meeting, goal is not to impress people, but for them to leave with some sort of skill

-  based in science, but only on the instructional side, not evaluation

-  short form workshops, tutorials

-  deeper relationships, collaboration under volunteer constraints with little hierarchical power, slower than more power-centric, but when you have the time, even if you also have the power it builds more trust"
