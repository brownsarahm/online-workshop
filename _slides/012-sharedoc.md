## Use a shared document
### collaboration strategy
If you do nothing else, do this! A shared document is a great way to focus participation in the meeting. The shared document can serve as a way for:
1. People to check-in/share their name/contact info
2. Have a clear agenda
3. Have participatory note taking in real-time
4. Simple polls and formative assessments of participants
5. Allow for small groups/break out groups to share with the large group
6. Give space for non-verbal updates.
7. Allow you to have break-out groups share the outcomes of their group with the large group.
If you do one thing with your online meeting, having a shared space where all participants can share information, links, snippets etc in document form is highly advised. The document allows people on the phone, and in a video call to engage, share information and get access links and other resource.
